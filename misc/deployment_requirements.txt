The deployment system has the ff objectives:
-rapid installation of contestant clients to various machines
-quick installation of other applications to non-contest machines

The deployment system will have the following components:
-installer application
-configuration file (generated by configuration_editor)

Ideal usage of the deployment system:
1.) volunteer plugs the usb to a contest machine
2.) s/he then runs the deployment system
3.) deployment system shows a simple menu asking what to installation
	choices are: server, presenter, contestant or utils
4.) volunteer makes his/her choice by clicking one of the options in the menu
5.) deployment system reads the deployment configuration data to determine
	installation path. The program will then copy the relevant files to
	the destination directory. Relvant files include the executable files,
	configuration files, database (if applicable) and .dll/.so files.
6.) upon completion of the operation, the system will indicate if the
	operation was completed or if errors had occurred.
7.) if the user doing the installation is done, s/he can then close the app
	and remove the usb to proceed to the next machine.
	
Deployment system configuration format:
Ideally the format will be in xml. But for the time being, we'll resort
to the ACM style of formatting. A sample configuration format can be found
in resources/deployer_config.cfg (to be renamed to .xml once we move to xml).

The format will be several lines of the following:
<module name> <installation path>

module name can be any of the following:
server, client, registration, qeditor, projector.

The installation path is any kind of valid path that the QDir class can support.
sample paths are:
/home/cerberus/
C:/cerberus
The paths need not exist. It will be the deployment app's job to create the
directories if they do not exist.
